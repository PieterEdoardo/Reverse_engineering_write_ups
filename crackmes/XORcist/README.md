# XORcist writeup
Thanks to S3c_Cult for publishign this binary https://crackmes.one/crackme/684f47bd2b84be7ea774390e

## Standard checks
First off, running it.

```
~/Projects/Reverse_Engineering/crackmes.one/XORcist
❯ ./xorcist 
What's the password?
test
Nuh Uh Nuh Uh.
```

So pretty standard input/output password check bin so far. It's call XORcist, so it probably uses XOR encoding for the password.

```
~/Projects/Reverse_Engineering/crackmes.one/XORcist
❯ checksec file xorcist

xorcist: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=4e8fe8f22756696045e4960d6ab793299b555298, for GNU/Linux 4.4.0, stripped
```

## Ghidra analysis
It's stripped so first goal is to identify main and any other important functions. Main is likely just the first function being called before __libc_start_main, like usual, and it does indeed look very main-y.
Inside here I can see the code that told me the password was wrong right away:
```
if ((x == 0) || (y % 100 == -1)) {
  puts("Nuh Uh Nuh Uh.");
}
```
All symbols are stripped, so I'll have to rename everything that looks meaningful as I go backwards from here.
Var Y is a random number, so the second condition looks very weird. The X value is like Y also declared with rand(), but it gets overwriten as `x = (*a)(b);` and then of course get's compared to 0; So I'll rename it again to `true_if_valid`. This seems to be the only part of the actual if statement input might control, so if my suspicion is correct, I need to find where stdin get's used, and where the XOR encoding is done, if any.

Going back up again, user input is likely here
```
puts("What\'s the password?");
fgets(b,0x20,stdin);
```
So I'll rename b to `user_input` for now. The a variable comes from a stripped function that only really does a strcpy(), call another stripped function, and call strcmp(). Now this looks juicy! So let's go ahead with the assumtion a is 'password related' and call it `password`.
This means our if statement and logic look like this now:
```
true_if_valid = (*password)(user_input);
if ((true_if_valid == 0) || (rand_value % 100 == -1)) {
  puts("Nuh Uh Nuh Uh.");
}
```
Looks like that would make sense, now let's keep going deeper into that strcmp function and see what that stripped function inside of it does. It really only has a for loop, so I'll go right ahead and rename the only local variable to `i`.
```
undefined4 i;

for (i = 0; *(char *)(param_1 + i) != '\0'; i = i + 1) {
  *(byte *)(param_1 + i) = *(byte *)(param_1 + i) ^ 0xa9;
}
return;
```
I am not very familiar yet with XOR encoding practices but this looks very promising, and I suspect this might be it. After reading more about it online we need to find an 'encryption key', Which the only thing here that looks like that is `0xA9`. So let's remember that for now. Something here must get 'XORred' against `0xA9` for all of these assumtions about the logic to make sense. So let's go back up and see what `param_1` is.

## Chasing the password
Chasing `param_1` back up into our parent function, it looks like the following:
```
strcpy(local_28,&DAT_00102023);
XOR_encoding(local_28);
iVar1 = strcmp(param_1,local_28);
```
If this is not a rabbithole then This raw data `DAT_00102023` must lead us to something usefull.
```

                                                                                          string_cmp:0010136b(*), 
                                                                                          string_cmp:0010136f(*),

```
So Ghidra doesn't really seem to know what to do with this, and I am tempted to go back up, because the code does also do a bunch of of more stuff, but when we went back from the final if statement, we didn't actually encounter any of it. So let's persue this. I need to see if unXORring `DD DA F6 D9 C4 C6 F6 CE C7 CE F6 C0 CA C5 00` against `0xA9` leads to anything that looks like a password. 

## Decoding the hex values
I need to see if the first byte `0xDD` is usefull. So, representing `0xDD` as binary, would be easy as D is only 2 steps back from 16 (I know, I do math weird), so that would be `1101` and `1101` for a binary value of `11011101` to represent `0xDD`. The next one is also easy because A is obviously `1010`, and 9 is just one step down from that; `1001`.

So with the binary value for `0xDD` being `11011101`, and `0xA9` being `10101001`, I can easily reverse the operation and get the password(Hopefully!). I've read up online and XOR is eXclusinve OR, so it's not just true if either value is true, but exclusively if only one of the is true, and only one. So `1 XOR 1 = 0`, where `1 OR 1 = 1`. But, `1 XOR 0 = 1`. Refreshing up on my logic gates, I can now chart the calculation out in a table:
| Bit Position | A | B | A XOR B |
|--------------|---|---|---------|
|      1       | 1 | 1 |    0    |
|      2       | 1 | 0 |    1    |
|      3       | 0 | 1 |    1    |
|      4       | 1 | 0 |    1    |
|      5       | 1 | 1 |    0    |
|      6       | 1 | 0 |    1    |
|      7       | 0 | 0 |    0    |
|      8       | 1 | 1 |    0    |

Our resulting binary is `01110100`, which looks promising, because single byte Unicode supported ASCII characters always start with a 0 to be backwards compatible, as back in the day ASCII was only 7 bits. Let's look it up! I like to use 
Cyberchef https://cyberchef.org/ for my encoding/decoding needs. and it recognizes the byte right away as the letter 't'. Now I don't want to do every byte by hand so looking online for a tool to automate the process. Using the tool from dcode https://www.dcode.fr/xor-cipher it results the raw data as `ts_pmo_gng_icl`. This doesn't sound like a password, but all the other signs point to that it should be so let's give it a go.

## Trying the decoded password
```
~/Projects/Reverse_Engineering/crackmes.one/XORcist
❯ ./xorcist
What's the password?
ts_pmo_gng_icl
Logged in as root.
```
Great! That was the password! 

## Conclusion
This binary took a standard input and compared it to a XOR encoded password that was hidden in the binary as raw data. To solve it, it was required to deconstruct the logical steps and perform the XOR operation in reverse.

Amazing bin, thanks again to S3c_cult for putting this together, was very fun.
