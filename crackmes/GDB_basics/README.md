# Recon
The title of this challenge has `gdb`, so to preserve the intention of the creator I'll try solve this primarily using `gdb`.

I cut out most of the `strings` output, but it seems that once the correct number(s) are given, it puts out `I_LOVE_YOU`.

# Debugging
As we've established during recon, this binary isn't stripped, so we know what main is. Look at it, it's rather small.

<img width="803" height="535" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ec3dd56-eb2c-4320-9313-9fd933e9b4db" />

I read a bunch of stuff on `gdb` and I learned some basic commands. I started off by setting a breakpoint on main and ran the program to get the real addresses with `break main` and `run` respectively. Looking at the actual logic it goes through acouple steps:
1. Declaring a variable on the stack.
2. Iterating through a for loop and it multiplies a value each cycle.
3. Calling `printf` print a message.
4. Calling `__isoc99_scanf` to take user input.
5. `CMP` user input with stack value.
6. Printing message based on whether user input was correct.

Still looking at the screenshot from above, the `CMP` at `0x5555555551ad` seem to be where the secret value is compared. But, this value, `rbp-0x4`. This naming is based on the negative location on the stack from rbp, so the they have negative values, like `-0x4` or `-0xc`. So if `0x4` is compared to user input, it'll should be as easy as finding where it get's declared and read it straight from the register there. It get's declared at the top of the script, and then only changed during the for loop.
```
MOV        EAX, dword ptr [rbp-0x4]
IMUL       EAX, dword ptr [rbp-0x8]
MOV        dword ptr [rbp-0x4], EAX
ADD        dword ptr [rbp-0x8], 0x1
```
First `0x4`'s value is loaded into the accumulator register, then it's multiplied by `0x8`, then the register's value is stored back on the stack at `rbp-0x4`. Lastly it goes `rbp-0x8 = rbp-0x8 + 1` before looping the whole thing. What this means, is that the script generates a high value as the secret number on the spot and it's not hardcoded stored anywhere. It *must* be readed out from the memory.
